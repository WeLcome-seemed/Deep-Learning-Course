# Deep-Learning-Course
some projects in my deep learning course
## homwork1
Compare SGD, batch and minibatch algorithm in single neuron which is three input and one output

data is below:

like:{input1, input2, input3, output}

{0, 0, 1, 0}

{0, 1, 1, 0}

{1, 0, 1, 1}

{1, 1, 1, 1}
## homework2
Drawing "epoch-error" line of algorithms in homework1 and comparing their learning speed(1000 epochs)
## homework3
Training single neuron in homework1 using data below(4000 epochs)

data is below:

like:{input1, input2, input3, output}

{0, 0, 1, 0}

{0, 1, 1, 1}

{1, 0, 1, 1}

{1, 1, 1, 0}
## homework4
Traning shallow neural network to solve XOR problem(one input layer, one hidden layer with 4 neurons and one output layer), data is the same as homework3
