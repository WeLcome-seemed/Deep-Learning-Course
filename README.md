# Deep-Learning-Course
some projects in my deep learning course
## homwork1
Compare SGD, batch and minibatch algorithm in single neuron which is three input and one output

data is below:

like:{input1, input2, input3, output}

{0, 0, 1, 0}

{0, 1, 1, 0}

{1, 0, 1, 1}

{1, 1, 1, 1}
## homework2
Drawing "epoch-error" line of algorithms in homework1 and comparing their learning speed(1000 epochs)
## homework3
Training single neuron in homework1 using data below(4000 epochs)

data is below:

like:{input1, input2, input3, output}

{0, 0, 1, 0}

{0, 1, 1, 1}

{1, 0, 1, 1}

{1, 1, 1, 0}
## homework4
Traning shallow neural network to solve XOR problem(one input layer, one hidden layer with 4 neurons and one output layer), data is the same as homework3
## homework5
Trying to change the number of nodes in hiden layer of homework4, and is that work for XOR problem? How to avoid not converging
## homework6
Solving XOR problem and using momentum algorithm
## homework7
Using cross entropy and sum of squared errors loss function to train the same neural network to solve XOR problem, and comparing their "error-epoch" line
## homework9
Training a NN to classificate pictures with 5*5 pixels
## homework10
Using training data to train NN in homework in homework9, and using other data to test it(running this program repeatly and is the output the same?Why?)
## homework11
Using other data to test NN in homework9
